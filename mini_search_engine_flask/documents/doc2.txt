Java is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1991. It is widely used for developing mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games, and much more.

Key Principles of Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java is an object-oriented language, which means it uses objects to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. The four main principles of OOP in Java are:

Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

Encapsulation: Binding the data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit called a class. This helps in protecting the data from unauthorized access.

Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class. This promotes code reusability.

Polymorphism: The ability of a single function or method to work in different ways based on the input. It can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).

Platform Independence

Java is designed to be platform-independent at both the source and binary levels. This means that Java code can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. The JVM converts the Java bytecode into machine code that can be executed by the host system

Robustness and Security

Java provides strong memory management through automatic garbage collection, which helps in avoiding memory leaks. It also has built-in security features such as the absence of pointers and the use of a security manager to define access rules

Multithreading

Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple threads to run concurrently. This is useful for performing multiple tasks simultaneously, such as handling user input while performing background computations

Basic Syntax and Structure

A basic Java program consists of classes and methods. Here is an example of a simple Java program that prints "Hello World":

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello World");
}
}
Explanation:

Class: The Main class is defined using the class keyword. It is the blueprint for creating objects.

Method: The main method is the entry point of the program. It is defined using the public, static, and void keywords.

Statement: The System.out.println statement prints the specified message to the console

Java Editions and Applications

Java has three main editions, each with different capabilities:

Java Standard Edition (JSE): Used for creating desktop applications.

Java Enterprise Edition (JEE): Used for creating large-scale, distributed applications that run on servers.

Java Micro Edition (JME): Used for developing applications for small devices like mobile phones and embedded systems
